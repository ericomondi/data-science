	PART I
1.	Correlation between number of courses and marks
	A correlation coefficient of approximately 0.417 indicates 
	a positive linear relationship between the number of courses 
	and student marks. The positive sign of the correlation coefficient
	 suggests that as the number of courses a student takes increases, 
	their marks tend to increase as well. In other words, there is a tendency
	for students who enroll in more courses to have higher marks.

	The value of the correlation coefficient, 0.417, provides information
 	about the strength of the relationship. A value closer to 1 indicates a stronger 
	positive relationship. In this case, 0.417 suggests a moderate or somewhat weak positive 
	relationship. It's not a very strong correlation, but it's still a noteworthy relationship.


2.	Correlation between time of study and marks

	A correlation coefficient of approximately 0.942 suggests a very strong and positive
	 linear relationship between the time of study and student marks. A correlation coefficient
	 close to 1 (0.942) indicates a very strong positive relationship between the time of study 
	and student marks. In this context, as the time of study increases, student marks tend to
	 increase as well. This suggests that students who spend more time studying tend to achieve 
	higher marks.

	The high correlation coefficient of 0.942 specifically suggests a strong linear relationship. 
	When you plot the data points on a scatterplot, they closely follow a linear trend. This means 
	that as the time of study increases, student marks increase in a consistent and linear manner.



	PART II

	 Hint: the Regression Equation is  marks y(marks) = m1x1(time_study) + m2x2(number_of_courses)

	m1(coefficient of time_study) = 5.399178787
	m2(coefficient of number_of_courses) = 1.864050743
	x1 = time_study
	x2 = number_of_courses 

	y = m1x1 + m2x2
